### What I learned

Creating a simple but not that simple site / web component like this is teaching me a lot, especially about planning and patience developing. Working with HTML and CSS only is quite challenging, and don't just use your hunch or blindly measuring the padding, the margin, or even just the font-size or font-weight. It's all about what's in the detail to make the component or sites look neat and clean.

Second, think first before write the code, because it will make your life easier, and your code will look clean and simple.

That's the lesson I've learned, and will continue to expand my skill as front-end web developer.
